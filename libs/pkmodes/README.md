# Public Key Cryptography Schemes Modes for =nil; Foundation's Cryptography Suite 

Public key cryptography modes library for =nil; Foundation's cryptography suite. Includes threshold, aggregatable modes for schemes defined within pubkey library.

## Building

This library uses Boost CMake build modules (https://github.com/BoostCMake/cmake_modules.git). 
To actually include this library in a project it is required to:

1. Add [CMake Modules](https://github.com/BoostCMake/cmake_modules.git) as submodule to taget project repository.
2. Add all the internal dependencies using [CMake Modules](https://github.com/BoostCMake/cmake_modules.git) as submodules to target project repository.
3. Initialize parent project with [CMake Modules](https://github.com/BoostCMake/cmake_modules.git) (Look at [crypto3](https://github.com/nilfoundation/crypto3.git) for the example)

## Dependencies

### Internal
* [Public Key Cryptography](https://github.com/nilfoundation/pubkey.git)

### External
* [Boost](https://boost.org) (>= 1.73)
