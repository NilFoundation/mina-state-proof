Crypto3.Algebra library extends the =nil; Foundation's cryptography suite and provides a set algebraic constructions
 being used mostly for public-key schemes
 implemented in way C++ standard library implies: concepts, algorithms, predictable behavior, latest standard features support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.
 
Crypto3.Algebra consists of several parts to review:

* [Manual](@ref algebra_manual).
* [Implementation](@ref algebra_impl).
* [Concepts](@ref algebra_concepts).
